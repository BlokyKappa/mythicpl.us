				<p id="r-info">It feels like it's been longer, but the site has been up for three months. I figured now would be a good time to share some fun technical stats with you about webservers, analytics, and whatever other stuff I feel like talking about. Thanks for all your support so far.</p>

			<h1 id="r-title" class="title title--large">site stats</h1>
			<p id="r-info">I brought the site up on November 28, 2016 after buying the mythicpl.us domain name for 88 cents during a Black Friday sale. My intent was to have a site where mythic plus information could be aggregated and edited based on player feedback. You guys have done a pretty great job of correcting the record if you notice something incorrect.</p>
			<div class="affixes-block">
					<ul class="affixes-list">
						<li id="r-stats1" class="stats-list__item"><span class="stat-color"><h1 class="title title--large--stats">209</h1></span><p class="affixes-list__note">Total number of Github commits as of March 7, 2017. That's 191 total edits to the page or around 2 edits a day for 93 days (November 28 to March 1, the time of writing).</p></li>
						<li id="r-stats1" class="stats-list__item"><span class="stat-color"><h1 class="title title--large--stats">22</h1></span><p class="affixes-list__note">Number of issues filed on Github to address incorrect data or issues with the site. 21 of those issues have been closed.</p></li>
						<li id="r-stats1" class="stats-list__item"><span class="stat-color"><h1 class="title title--large--stats">9</h1></span><p class="affixes-list__note">Pull requests submitted. 3 of those are from Gnarfoz fixing table information. 2 of those were site restylings.</p></li>

					</ul>
			</div>
<p id="r-info">User input is really important in a game where strategies or ways to do things change every week. The goal with having everything visible on Github was to allow players to drop in their thoughts, ideas, or corrections easily while having a visible record of things to do and enforcing accountability.</p>
			<div class="affixes-block">
					<ul class="affixes-list">
						<li id="r-stats2" class="stats-list__item"><span class="stat-color"><h1 class="title title--large--stats">383,139</h1></span><p class="affixes-list__note">Total pageviews since online. Repeated views of a single page are counted.</p></li>
						<li id="r-stats2" class="stats-list__item"><span class="stat-color"><h1 class="title title--large--stats">292,249</h1></span><p class="affixes-list__note">Total sessions counted. A session is a time where someone is engaged with a site (e.g. clicks a link, etc). Of those sessions <strong><span class="stat-color">55.1%</span></strong> were return users!</p></li>
						<li id="r-stats2" class="stats-list__item"><span class="stat-color"><h1 class="title title--large--stats">131,268</h1></span><p class="affixes-list__note">Unique users as counted by Google.</p></li>

Either it's quick to find the information you want, or the page is garbage and you want to leave! (I hope it's the former though)</p></li>
					</ul>
					<div>
					<canvas id="sessions-chart"></canvas>
					<p id="r-info">Of note: the majority of sessions in November came from launch day (day one had over 5,000 concurrent sessions!). There was a considerable jump in traffic in January and Februrary that I attribute to end of holidays and rising in the Google search results.</p>

			<h3 id="r-title" class="title">the server</h3>
			<p id="r-info">The web server is a tiny ass Linux box running Fedora 24. It has 512MB of RAM (2GB in SWAP) and 1 CPU core. I'm using Github as a basic CRM for the web site. I'm running this site off an established server I serve a few other things off for myself.</p>
			<p id="r-info"></p>
			<p id="r-info">Recently I started shipping all my webserver data to a private Graylog instance to gather performance metrics on the webserver. The goal is to eventually phase out Google Analytics so I don't have to serve that extra javascript to you or give your browser information to Google. I don't have any rad data to share with you from that yet though. If this site is still relevant in a few months maybe I'll put up another one of these.</p> 
			<div class="affixes-block">
			<ul class="affixes-list">
						<li id="r-stats1" class="stats-list__item"><span class="stat-color"><h1 class="title title--large--stats" id="days"></h1></span><p class="affixes-list__note">Current uptime in days. Last time I took the server down was to do a distribution upgrade from Fedora 21 to 24.</p></li>
						<li id="r-stats1" class="stats-list__item"><span class="stat-color"><h1 class="title title--large--stats">66GB</h1></span><p class="affixes-list__note">Total data served so far. I took the sum data of each page and its assets, broke them out by individual page views and did the math. The routes page is the primary contributer due to the cool Eye of Azshara map.</p></li>
						<li id="r-stats1" class="stats-list__item"><span class="stat-color"><h1 class="title title--large--stats">0.05ms</h1></span><p class="affixes-list__note">Average time in milliseconds it takes for the server to respond to and complete a page request.</p></li>

			<p>Well, I guess that's it. You can get a lot done with a tiny cloud based server.</p>
			<p>Thanks again for all your support, friends.</p>
