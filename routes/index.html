                <p>I appreciate and listen to your feedback. If you have suggestions please open an issue on the <a href="https://github.com/domainzero/mythicpl.us/issues">GitHub</a> page so I can keep track of all the suggestions.</p>

        <h1>The Arcway</h1>
        <div>
            <h2>Route</h2>
            <p>The start of this dungeon is random, with a door blocking off either the Withered path leading to Ivanyr for the first boss or Demon path leading to General Xakal for the first boss. This determines the route for the rest of the dungeon.</p>
		<h2>Trash tips and warnings</h2>
     	<h3>Forgotten Spirits</h3> 
            <p>Forgotten Spirits appear randomly through the dungeon and cast <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=226269/torment">Torment</a>. While this spell can be interrupted and line-of-sighted, the mob will not move after aggroed. This can be advantageous if one is accidentally pulled as this allows the group to avoid Torment stacks while dealing with other trash, or to reset their Torment stacks while killing the Spirit.</p>
		<h3>Demon area trash</h3>
            <p>Eredar Chaosbringers bring a lot of wipe potential to any pull that they're a part of. The two most problematic spells are <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=211757/portal-argus">Portal: Argus</a> and <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=226285">Demonic Ascension</a>. Portal: Argus spawns a bunch of imps which target random players and cast Fireballs at them. Portal: Argus is cast on pretty much any keystone difficulty the group is almost guaranteed a wipe, especially at higher keystone difficulties. Make sure it is interrupted. Demonic Ascenion will revive an Eredar Chaosbringer upon death, bringing then back as a corehound or a wrathguard. The Chaosbringer is full healed and granted new abilities with both forms. This cast can be interrupted and the buff can be purged/dispelled/spellstolen before the Chaosbringer dies, so there's no reason for a group to ever have a Chaosbringer revive as a demon.</p>
            <p>Wrathguard Felblades appear in most packs with Eredar Chaosbringers. They do moderate to high damage to random players by blining to them and debuffing them with <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=211756">Searing Wound</a>. Searing Wound cannot be dispelled and does lots of damage at higher keystone difficulties.</p>
            <p>Wyrmtongue Scavengers deal moderate to high party damage by choosing random players and throwing objects at them. This damage adds up quickly if the Wyrmtongue Scavengers are not stunned and dealt with.</p>
            <p>Dreadborne Seers cast <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=211771">Prophecies of Doom</a> dealing high AoE damage. If Enraging is active the Dreadborne Seer will need to be bursted down immediately after it enrages so Prophecies of Doom isn't cast during Enrage. Use personals or big AoE healing cooldowns if proactively to avoid taking massive damage from Prophecies of Doom. Additionally, the Dreadborne Seer will summon Eyes of the Beast that randomly target players with <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=211777">Optic Blast</a>. Players should avoid the Optic Blast by spreading out so multiple players aren't hit by the same beam. Taking an Optic Blast and a Prophecies of Doom back-to-back can be fatal at higher keystone difficulties.</p>

        <h3>Withered trash</h3>
            <p>At the very start of the Withered path there's a bunch of Plagued Rats. They put a stacking disease on targets that needs to be dispelled. Stack up, stun and AoE the rats down.</p>
             <p>The normal Withered trash isn't too intense. Interrupt <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=210662">Unstable Flux</a> and <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=210684">Siphon Essence</a>.</p>

            <h3>Arcane trash (Ivanyr)</h3>
                <p>Get out of <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=211217">Arcane Slicer</a> cast by the Arcane Anomalies or die.</p>
                <p>Kick <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=226206">Arcane Reconstitution</a> on all arcane mobs or they will heal to full. Having a cast of this go off is very detrimental to completing the dungeon quickly.</p>
                <p>Kick <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=211115">Phase Breach</a>. Its damage can be unmanagable at higher keystone difficulties if multiple casts get off.</p>
                <p>Mana Wyrms can be line-of-sighted, allowing the group to engage them all at once and prevent a lot of damage. The group can line-of-sight using the pillars on the bridge or line-of-sight near the entrance to Ivanyr's room.</p>

            <h3>Spider trash (Nal'tira)</h3>
                <p>The small spiders in Nal'tira's room explode on death. Avoid being near them as they die.</p>
                <p>The normal size spiders will <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=211543">Devour</a> random players. Spells that break roots will free players from the spiders.</p>
                <p>Stack up for the second wave of jumping spider trash so the spiders can be quickly cleaved down.</p>
                <p>Be careful with postioning here because the boss will drop down into the middle of the room after the trash dies and can be body pulled easily.</p>

            <h3>Nightborne trash (Corstilax)</h3>
                <p>Make sure the mobs are moved out of the Nightborne Reclaimer's <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=211037">Celerity Zone</a> as it gives 50% haste to anything inside it. Players should get in the Celerity Zone for a huge haste buff.</p>
                <p>Nightborne Spellswords will put <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=211000">Nether Wound</a> on the tank which can add up to some nasty damage on high keystone difficulties.</p>
                <p><a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=210868">Arcane Barrier</a> can be interrupted by stunning or knocking back the mob from behind.</p>

        <h2>Boss tips</h2>
            <p>Ivanyr or Xakal will be the first boss depending on RNG, use Bloodlust on whatever boss is first. Lust should be used again on the third boss encountered, though it could be saved if the boss is Corstilax.</p>
            <p><strong>Ivanyr</strong> - Pretty much the same as normal. Avoid the balls of mana, interrupt Overcharge Mana immediately. Ivanyr doesn't have any one-shot abilities to worry about.</p>
            <p><strong>General Xakal</strong> - Avoid <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=212030/shadow-slash">Shadow Slash</a> or die. Getting knocked into a <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=197776/fel-fissure">Fel Fissure</a> by <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=197810/wicked-slam">Wicked Slam</a> will one shot players on most keystone difficulties. Be prepared to use a personal for Wicked Slam if not at full health. Do not get hit by the Bombardment by the bats. The bats will come down during the fight and can be cleaved, but don't keep them up too long as they enrage over time and can deal fatal damage. <strong>Do not send them to the tank if Necrotic is active (tricks, misdirect, etc)</strong> unless their stacks have fallen off.</p>
            <p><strong>Corstilax</strong> -This boss can be cheesed by keeping up the Reclaimer from the last pull before the boss until it casts a Celerity Zone. Celerity Zone is basically a free Bloodlust for this fight. Free people from <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=195791">Quarantine</a> immediately or they will die. Pick up the haste pools on the ground for a huge haste buff but be aware that having high stacks of the buff makes the boss suck players in faster during <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=196115">Cleansing Force</a>. Dodge Supression, dodge Destabilized Orbs.</p>
            <p><strong>Nal'tira</strong> - Dodge Blink Strikes or get one shot. Kill the add spiders that get spawned or players could be rooted in Blink Strikes and die a horrible death.</p>
            <p><strong>Advisor Luther Vandross</strong> - Avoid standing next to the floating geodes. They explode and will kill most players. Interrupt Accelerating Blast or let the cast go through and spellsteal the buff. The fastest route back after <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=203882">Banish in Time</a> will depend on where the group was placed after after phase transition. If placed at Ivanyr's or Xakal's arena, head north toward Vandros. If placed at Corstilax or Nal'tira, head through the middle. When the group makes it back to the boss, players run away with Unstable Mana or die. Continue doing the earlier mechanics. Bloodlust after re-engaging if available.</p>

    <h1>Black Rook Hold</h1>
        <div>
        <h2>Route</h2>
		  <p>Take the right door, invis pot at the last possible moment and skip all the starting trash. From here on out the dungeon is very linear and there isn't any trash that can be skipped.</p>
        <h2>Trash tips and warnings</h2> 
            <p>The stairs after the first boss are full of spiders. They explode after death. Do not stand in the green swirly they leave on the ground.</p>
            <p>Risen Arcanist's <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=200248">Arcane Blitz</a> can be deadly if not interrupted. Make sure the Arcanists die quickly.</p>
            <p>Risen Scout's <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=200291/knife-dance">knife dance</a> can be enough to wipe a group at high keystone levels (especially with Fortified) and should be line of sighted or stunned/knocked back to be interrupted.</p>
            <p>Wrathguard Bladelord's <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=201139/brutal-assault">Brutal Assault</a> should be interrupted via knockback or stun as it deals insane damage, especially at higher keystones.</p>
            <p>The bats before Smashspite do not aggro unless they are attacked or are fixated on a nearby player by a Felspite Dominator casting <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=203163/sic-bats">Sic Bats!</a>. The tank can pull the Felspite Dominators on the landing down to the bottom of the stairs so additional bats aren't pulled. The last 3 Dominators can be pulled into the boss room for the same purpose. Interrupt <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=227913/felfrenzy">Felfrenzy</a>. On problematic affixes (necrotic, enraging) make sure to stun and kite the bats if players are fixated.</p>
        
        <h2>Boss tips</h2>
            <p>Amalgam of Souls - Use Bloodlust or Heroism here. Killing the adds that are spawned at 50% is a top priority unless everyone has a cooldown that will allow them to live through <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=196587/soul-burst">soul burst</a>. Soul Burst will one shot most classes even with one stack of <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=196930/soulgorge">Soulgorge</a> at most keystone levels.</p>
            <p>Illysanna Ravencrest - On most keystone levels the adds can be ignored. If players are taking too much damage from leaving the Risen Arcanist up it may be best to just kill it (on higher difficulties I would say this isn't optional). Spread out for <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=197546/brutal-glaive">Brutal Glaive</a> as having more than a few players affected with it (especially with Tyrannical) can be incredibly difficult to heal.</p>
            <p>Smashspite - At high keystone levels it may be beneficial to use a personal before <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=198073/earthshaking-stomp">Earthshaking Stomp</a> is cast. Make sure no one takes two charges or they will most likely be instantly killed. (Do mechanics lol)</p> 
            <p>Kur'talos Ravencrest/Latosius/Dreadlord guy (Bloodlust on Phase 2) - Phase 1 is business as usual, do not get hit by the bouncing glaive or the big purple lazer. When the fight transitions to dreadlord phase, use a personal cooldown to avoid the first <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=202019/shadow-bolt-volley">shadow bolt volley</a>. I have seen people get oneshotted by it on 10+. Use heroism or bloodlust after you get buffed (shortly after the first Shadow Bolt Volley). Kill <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=201733/stinging-swarm">stinging swarm</a> immediately as its damage is out of control on all keystone levels. Avoid purple and green.</p>

    <div data-collapse>
    <h1>court of stars</h1>
    <div>
        <h2>Route</h2>
            <p>Kill the first sentry patrol. Skip the first construct by jumping through the canal to the right. Hug the building to the right and kill the next construct as well as the trash near the pylon. Be mindful of positioning and AoE use here trash surroudns this area and it WILL wipe the group if too much is pulled. Kill the trash on the bridge and proceed to the boss arena.</p>
            <p>After killing the first boss, proceed into the building, killing the construct on the way. Be mindful in the next big here as there are plenty of patrols to accidentally pull. There's no strict route here as Felbound Enforcers spawn randomly across the map they must be killed to get the minibosses to be engaged.</p>
            <p><i>Note: there are <a href="http://i.imgur.com/Di4QEe4.jpg">class/race/profession specific buffs</a> scattered all over the map at this point. Most notable is Discarded Junk which can be used to instantly kill a miniboss (or two if you kill a felbound enforcer, immediately use the trap and then kite both bosses over the trap) which can save a ton of time.</i></p>
            <p>Make sure to get a disguise from the NPC out front after the second boss is dead. play Guess Who with a dreadlord, and proceed to fight the Dreadlord miniboss. As the Dreadlord miniboss is dying someone can start running toward the final boss door so they can get it unlocked while the RP is going.</p>
            <p><i>Note: DeadlyBossMods automatically calls out the infiltrator's traits in party chat after you've interacted with a Chatty Rumormonger. There are some WeakAuras that do this too if you find yourself running CoS a lot.</i>.</p>
    <h2>Trash tips and warnings</h2>
            <p>Interrupt Guardian Construct's <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=225100/charging-station">Charging Station</a>. This heals ALL nearby enemies for an unruly amount at higher keystone levels (especially when Fortified is active) and also increases enemy damage. Not sure if it can be spellstolen or dispelled. (haven't tried)</p>
            <p>Mana Saber's <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=209516/mana-fang">Mana Fang</a> can be devastating on higher keystones, especially if they get bolstered or have Fortified. These mobs should be killed as soon as possible while interrupting the Guardian Constructs. The debuff can be dispelled.</p>
            <p>Burst down Watchful Inquisitors as <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=212784/eye-storm">eye storm</a> can do unreasonable AoE damage if left unchecked.</p>
            <p>Blazing Imps are the worst and need to be killed as fast as possible. <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=211401/drifting-embers">Drifting Embers</a> will deal very high group damage if left unchecked. Arcane Torrent, Bursting Shot, Typhoon, and any other AoE CC should be used on the imps. Try to avoid pulling packs of imps with other mobs so there is less to worry about.</p>
            <p>Felbound Enforcer's <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=211464/fel-detonation">Fel Detonation</a> MUST BE line of sighted by anyone that can at higher keystone levels as it is very difficult to keep five people alive if they have the DoT on them. This will wipe a group easily on 9+ difficulties. There are plenty of buildings/pillars/corners in the area that can be used to line of sight the cast.</p>
    
        <h2>Boss tips</h2>
            <p> Patrol Captain Gerdo (Bloodlust) - Poison the vial if the group has an alchemist or rogue! This is a big time saver and wipe deterrent as it kills Gerdo instantly at 25% HP, preventing his enrage.  Pull the boss back toward the bridge that leadsto the boss arena to avoid accidentally pulling more trash. Jump to dispel <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=207278/arcane-lockdown">Arcane Lockdown</a> as this will kill you very quickly at higher keystone levels. Avoid the AoE damage telegraphed on the ground and ignore the adds.</p>
            <p>Fire warlock lady (Talixae Flamewreath) - Pull her back into the pavilion behind her starting position if the group has chosen to skip the patrol in front of her. Stack for <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=211457/infernal-eruption">Infernal Eruption</a> to get all the imps to spawn near each other. The tank should move the boss away from the pools and the imps should be killed immediately when they spawn. Kick Withering Soul.</p>
            <p>Advisor Melandrus (Bloodlust) - This fight is a supreme DPS and healing check, especially with Tyrannical. <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=209602/blade-surge">Blade Surge</a> targets the furthest player, doing burst damage and applying a DoT that does high damage. Dodge Blade Surge in any way available. Blade Surge also leaves a clone of Melandrus at the position of the player it was cast at which mirrors Melandrus' other abilities. Avoid the lines on the ground and avoid the clones of Melandrus.</p>
