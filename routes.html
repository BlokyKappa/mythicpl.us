				<h1>routes tl;dr</h1>
        <p>Thanks to everyone who provided me additional information or made me aware of skips I hadn't done. Special shoutouts to Anchises for writing nice, short guides.</p>

    <h1>Black Rook Hold</h1>
		<p>Take the right door, invis pot at the last possible moment and skip all the starting trash. From here on out the dungeon is very linear and the trash pulls are very straight foward.</p>
    <h2>Trash tips</h2> 
    <p>Risen Scout's <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=200291/knife-dance">knife dance</a> can be enough to wipe a group at high keystone levels (especially with Fortified) and should be line of sighted or stunned/knocked back.</p>
    <p>Wrathguard Bladelord's <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=201139/brutal-assault">Brutal Assault</a> should be interrupted via knockback or stun because it deals insane damage, especially at higher keystones.
    <p>The bat corridor before Smashspite is only as bad as you make it. The bats do not aggro unless they are attacked or are fixated on a player due to the Felspite Dominator's casting <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=203163/sic-bats">Sic Bats!</a>. Your tank can pull the Felspite Dominators on the landing down to the bottom of the stairs so your chances of cleaving a million bats are lower. You can pull the last 3 into the boss room for the same purpose. Interrupt <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=227913/felfrenzy">Felfrenzy</a>. On problematic affixes (necrotic, enraging) make sure you stun and kite the bats if you are fixated.
    <h2>Boss tips</h2>
    <p>Amalgam of Souls - Business as usual. Killing the adds that are spawned at 50% is a top priority unless everyone has a cooldown that will allow them to live through <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=196587/soul-burst">soul burst</a>. The ability will one shot most classes even with one stack of Soulgorge at 4+. If you have absurd CC available to you, these adds can be permanently cc'd and despawn after Soulburst is cast.</p>
    <p>Illysanna Ravencrest - On most difficulties it is most beneficial to just ignore the adds and burn the boss. If people are taking too much damage from having the Risen Arcanist up it may be best to just kill it. If you have an ability that can negate a spell case (Feign Death, Aspect of the Turtle, active spell mitigation) try to avoid Brutal Glaive if you notice it being cast on you.</p>
    <p>Smashspite - Business as usual again. At high difficulties it may be beneficial to use a personal before <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=198073/earthshaking-stomp">Earthshaking Stomp</a> is cast. Make sure no one takes two charges or they will probably be instantly killed. (Do mechanics lol)</p> 
    <p>Kur'talos Ravencrest/Latosius/Dreadlord guy - Phase 1 is business as usual, do not get hit by the bouncing glaive or the big purple lazer. When the fight transitions to dreadlord phase use a personal cooldown to avoid the first <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=202019/shadow-bolt-volley">shadowbolt volley</a>. I have seen people get oneshotted by it on 10+. Kill <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=201733/stinging-swarm">stinging swarm</a> immediately as its damage is out of control on higher difficulties. Avoid purple.</p>
